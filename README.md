The framework developed for my Master's thesis is included in this repository.

It can be used to generate text with LLMs. The generated output can be evaluated with regard to gender bias.
The datasets are in German. Three datasets include open text generation prompts:

- GenderPersona
- StereoPersona
- NeutralPersona

Two datasets include Q&A tasks:

- GerBBQ+
- SexistStatements

A comprehensive description of the datasets, metrics and implementation can be found in the [pdf file of my thesis]('Gender Bias in German LLMs.pdf')
